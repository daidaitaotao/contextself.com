        Water does not resist. It flows around obstacles, finds the lowest point,
        and in its softness, wears away stone. There is something here about how
        to move through the world.

        We spend so much energy trying to optimize, to maximize, to reach some peak.
        But perhaps the question is not "what is the best outcome?" but rather
        "what state can sustain itself?"

        Human nature is not a problem to be solved. It is a landscape to be understood—
        with its valleys and peaks, its rivers and deserts. We navigate it, we don't
        conquer it.

        Equilibrium is not stillness. A river at equilibrium is still flowing.
        A forest at equilibrium is still growing and dying. Balance is dynamic,
        not static.

      A space for exploring ideas about how things find balance,
      why we are the way we are, and what the old wisdom still has to teach.
