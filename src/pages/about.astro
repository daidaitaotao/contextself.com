    <h1>About</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        This is a space for thinking out loud about questions that don't have
        clean answers. About why we are the way we are. About how things find
        balance. About what the old texts still have to teach us.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why Taoism</h2>
      <p>
        I keep returning to the Tao Te Ching because it approaches truth sideways.
        It doesn't argue or prove—it suggests, and then steps back. It's comfortable
        with paradox. It trusts that some things become clearer when you stop
        trying so hard to grasp them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao" is not a riddle to solve.
        It's a reminder that language has limits, and the most important things
        often live in the spaces between words.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Human Nature</h2>
      <p>
        We are strange creatures. We build systems to constrain ourselves, then
        rebel against them. We seek connection and solitude in the same breath.
        We are capable of great kindness and terrible cruelty, often on the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested not in what humans should be, but in what we are. The patterns
        that repeat across cultures and centuries. The tensions that never fully resolve.
        Understanding doesn't require approval—just honest observation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Equilibrium</h2>
      <p>
        Most of Western thought is about optimization—finding the best, the fastest,
        the most. But living systems don't optimize; they balance. A forest doesn't
        maximize trees. A body doesn't maximize any single function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equilibrium thinking asks different questions: What can sustain itself?
        What resolves into stability? What patterns emerge when forces find balance?
        These feel like more honest questions about how the world actually works.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Xianglong. I read, I think, I write when I have something to say.
        This site is where I put the thoughts that don't fit anywhere else.
