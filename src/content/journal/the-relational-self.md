There's a question I keep returning to: **Am I the person I experience from the inside, or am I the person others see?**

Most days I feel like both. And neither.

I'm building software that observes people—detects faces, tracks who appears with whom, measures how bodies move together. The more I build, the more I wonder: what am I actually capturing? The person? Or just the space around them?

## The Question

Here's what I'm trying to figure out:

**There is me**—the one who wakes up at 3am with thoughts I don't share, who has preferences and fears and a voice in my head that narrates my life.

**There is me-as-seen-by-others**—the son my parents imagine, the friend my friends know, the professional my colleagues work with. Different people see different versions. None of them is wrong, exactly. But none is complete.

**And then there are my relationships**—the connections themselves. Not me, not them, but the space between.

Are those relationships *part* of me? Or are they just... context?

## Why This Matters to Me

I'm an Asian gay man in my mid-thirties. I've spent my life navigating between worlds that don't always understand each other.

With my family, I'm a son with expectations attached—some spoken, most imagined. The good job, the stability, the question of grandchildren that hangs unasked.

With my queer friends, I'm someone who came out later than some, who still code-switches when I visit home, who understands the particular exhaustion of managing what different people know about you.

At work, I'm a technologist. The personal stuff stays personal.

Each of these contexts shapes who I am. But here's what I've been sitting with: **which one is "really" me?**

The Taoist answer might be: the question is wrong. There is no fixed self to find. The self is a process, not a thing. It emerges in relationship, dissolves, re-forms.

But that's abstract. Let me try to make it concrete.

## What the Research Says (Simply)

Scientists have studied how relationships shape identity. Here's what they found, in plain language:

### We see ourselves through others' eyes

Cooley (1902) called this the "looking-glass self." We don't form our self-image by looking inward—we form it by imagining how others see us.

The data: we're more influenced by what we *think* others think than by what they actually think (Shrauger & Schoeneman, 1979).

**What this means**: I grew up with an image of what a good son should be. That image came from imagining my parents' expectations—not from them explicitly stating them. The looking-glass showed me a reflection, and I became it.

Coming out meant breaking the mirror. Or at least, choosing which reflections to believe.

### Who we spend time with shapes who we become

Eagle, Pentland, & Lazer (2009) found that who you're physically near—and who reciprocates—predicts who you'd call a friend with 95% accuracy.

**What this means**: Relationships aren't just nice-to-have. They're structural. They literally shape our social world, and our social world shapes us.

But the data misses something. My most important relationships aren't always the most frequent. Some people I see once a year changed my life. Frequency isn't depth.

### Bridges get ahead—and get tired

Burt (1992) found that people who connect different social circles get promoted faster and have better ideas.

**What this means for me**: I'm often a bridge. Between my traditional family and my queer life. Between Asian cultural expectations and American individualism. Between technical work and philosophical questions.

Bridges are useful. People walk across them.

Being a bridge means never fully belonging on either side.

### Your network reveals what you hide

This one hit me hard.

Jernigan & Mistree (2009) showed they could predict if someone was gay just from their Facebook friends—with 78% accuracy—even if the person never said anything about their orientation.

**What this means**: Your relationships out you. Not because anyone betrays you, but because patterns speak.

I came out when I was ready, on my terms. But some people don't have that choice. Their connections reveal them before they're prepared.

This is why I'm careful about what taocore-human should do. The power to observe is the power to expose. Privacy isn't about having something to hide. It's about controlling your own story.

## So Are My Relationships Part of Me?

I've been thinking about this through a few lenses:

### The Western view: No

In Western psychology, the self is inside you. Your personality, your traits, your essence. Relationships are external—things you *have*, not things you *are*.

From this view, I'm the same person whether I'm with my family or my friends. The contexts change; I don't.

### The relational view: Yes

Other traditions—and some Western psychologists—see the self as fundamentally relational. You don't exist as a self until you're in relationship. The "I" emerges from the "we."

From this view, I'm *literally different* with different people. Not performing, not masking—actually different. The relationship is part of what I am in that moment.

### The Taoist view: The question dissolves

In Taoist thinking, fixed categories are the problem. There is no unchanging "self" to locate. There's just process, flow, becoming.

The self is like a river. You can point to it, but it's not a thing—it's a pattern of movement. It exists in relation to the banks, the rain, the ocean it flows toward.

From this view, asking "are my relationships part of me?" is like asking "is the riverbank part of the river?" The question assumes a boundary that doesn't really exist.

## What I've Come To

I don't have a clean answer. But here's where I've landed:

**My relationships are part of me the way my language is part of me.** I didn't choose Mandarin or English—they were given to me by context. But they shape how I think, what I can express, who I can connect with. They're not external to me; they're woven into how I experience the world.

**The "me" that others see is also me.** Not the whole me, but not false either. My mother sees someone real. My friends see someone real. My colleagues see someone real. These aren't masks—they're facets.

**The tension between these facets is also me.** The exhaustion of bridging. The code-switching. The feeling of never fully belonging anywhere. That's not a failure of identity—it's what identity feels like when you're stretched across multiple worlds.

## What This Means for taocore-human

I'm building a system that observes people. This research tells me:

1. **Observation captures relationships, not selves.** When I detect who appears with whom, I'm seeing the space between people—not who they "really are."

2. **Patterns are real but meaning is contextual.** Proximity, synchrony, co-occurrence—these are measurable. But what they mean depends on culture, history, individual circumstance. The numbers don't interpret themselves.

3. **Some observations shouldn't be made.** Just because I *can* detect patterns doesn't mean I *should*. The power to see is the power to expose. A system that observes has obligations.

What taocore-human should do:
- Report patterns, not identities
- Include uncertainty in everything
- Refuse to label relationships ("friend," "family," "romantic")
- Never predict outcomes for individuals
- Protect what people haven't chosen to reveal

## A Final Thought

There's a Taoist idea: *the Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao*.

Maybe it's the same with the self. The self that can be observed is not the complete self. What I capture with cameras and algorithms is real—but it's a shadow on the wall, not the thing casting it.

I build tools that watch. And I've learned that watching has limits.

The river keeps flowing. The reflection on the surface is not the water.
