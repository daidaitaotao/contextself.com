description: "Why I'm keeping this journal"

Every journey needs a first step, even if you don't know where you're going.

This journal is a place to document my explorations—both the philosophical questions I'm wrestling with and the technical problems I'm trying to solve. The two aren't as separate as they might seem. TaoCore grew out of reading the Tao Te Ching and wondering: what if software could find balance instead of chasing optima?

I don't know what shape these entries will take. Some might be observations about human nature. Some might be notes on equilibrium mathematics. Some might be fragments that don't fit anywhere else.

The point isn't to produce polished essays. It's to think out loud, to notice patterns, to leave a trail of where my mind has wandered.

Let's see where this goes.
